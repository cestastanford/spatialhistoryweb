This website is no longer updated and has been replaced with a static copy. The <strong>Spatial History Project</strong> was active at Stanford University from 2007-2022, engaging in dozens of collaborative projects led by faculty, staff, graduate students, post-docs, visiting scholars and others at Stanford and beyond. More than 150 undergraduate students from more than a dozen disciplines contributed to these projects. In addition to a robust intellectual exchange built through these partnerships, research outputs included major monographs, edited volumes, journal articles, museum exhibitions, digital articles, robust websites, and dozens of lightweight interactive visualizations, mostly developed with Adobe Flash (now defunct). While most of those publications live on in other forms, the content exclusive to this website is preserved in good faith through this static version of the site.

			<div class="abstract floatleft" style="width:590px;letter-spacing:0.04em;">Before Hetch Hetchy, there was Searsville Dam. Built in 1892 to supply the burgeoning city of San Francisco, the lake was never used as a drinking water supply. Instead, it became a recreation destination used by the Stanford swim teams and eventually a part of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. The aging dam stands today as a controversial structure intimately linked to the ecosystems in and around the San Francisquito Creek. A century&rsquo;s worth of deposited sediment has helped create a rich upstream wetland habitat for bat and bird species, but it has also nearly filled the reservoir and the dam blocks steelhead trout from returning to their historic spawning areas. Stanford University is currently undergoing a study to evaluate Searsville Dam alternatives, each that will involve significant environmental restoration to help establish a sustainable equilibrium for the future.</div>

			<div class="header" style="margin-top:10fpx;padding-bottom:12px;">Introduction</div>			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">This project investigates the historical ecology of the San Francisquito Creek watershed and reconstructs a bird&rsquo;s eye view the landscape as it may have looked before the area was settled by Europeans (circa late 1700s). The purpose of the study is to provide information for future restoration discussions, to improve our understanding of what the area looked like, and how the ecosystem functioned prior to major human settlement. The primary outcome of our study is a landscape reconstruction - a visual synthesis of our best understanding of the historical landscape drawn from historical evidence, expert advice, and GIS analysis. The precise extents of redwoods, oaks, and other vegetation classes are exceedingly difficult to determine. The maps here show a &ldquo;best informed guess&rdquo; estimate of the extent, size, and density of these vegetation classes based on environmental suitability modeling informed by historical assumptions (described on the far right). Further research is necessary to validate the model assumptions, make informed adjustments to the extents of each vegetation class, and refine the visual depiction of historical conditions in specific areas of interest.</div>			<div class="number floatright">2</div>

			<div class="header" style="margin-top:10fpx;padding-bottom:12px;">Methodology</div>			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Our analysis focused on describing the historical hydrologic and topographic conditions and the extent, size, and density of six major vegetation types (redwood forest, oak woodland and savannah, riparian forest, grassland, chaparral and marshland) common in the Santa Cruz Mountains. While we have detailed survey data prior to the dam construction that describes the hydrology and topography of the study area, our knowledge of vegetation is mostly based on written accounts and is spatially imprecise.&nbsp;</div>			<div class="number floatright">7</div>

		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">GIS suitability analysis is a predictive technique that balances multiple and diverse criteria to create suitability &ldquo;rules&rdquo; for land cover classes. In an iterative process, rules are weighted against one another to produce a series of suitability surfaces that define the probability of occurrence of each vegetation type, for example. Suitability rules are often based on deductive physical properties (e.g. water flows downhill), but can be derived from vague or qualitative statements (e.g. &ldquo;the hillsides were covered with redwoods&rdquo;) or partially quantifiable data (e.g. &ldquo;redwoods most often occur on north-facing slopes&rdquo;). This allows the analysis to make use of knowledge from diverse experts and to provide feedback on results at several stages. This iterative process ideally results in a realistic predictive map as experts have several opportunities to reject unrealistic options. However, caution must always be used in interpreting such maps as they are a &ldquo;best informed guess&rdquo; with considerable uncertainty.</div>			<div class="number floatright">8</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">We developed an initial suitability model based on a regional analysis of environmental conditions (e.g. slope, aspect, elevation) for each vegetation class in present-day sites on the eastern slopes of the Santa Cruz Mountains. These rules were then applied to historical topographical conditions as derived from a detailed survey of the study site in and around San Francisquito Creek ahead of the Searsville Dam construction (1891) to identify likely areas for each vegetation class. Our analysis was done at a high enough resolution (1m pixel grid) to produce large scale maps of the area.</div>			<div class="number floatright">9</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Next, we critically analyzed the best available historical information (e.g. explorer accounts, secondary sources, maps, photos, etc.) to improve the initial raw suitability analysis. To guide this process, we developed a set of &ldquo;historical assumptions&rdquo; through a series of workshops with participants from Jasper Ridge, Stanford, and the wider public in botany, ecology, hydrology, geography and archealogy. The workshops and a digital survey culminated in a set of historical assumptions agreed upon by the participants and a coarse estimate of the historical species composition of each vegetation class.</div>			<div class="number floatright">10</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Weighted suitability surfaces were calculated and compared by balancing the relative importance of factors such as climate and land-use practices. Each result was then evaluated against our historical assumptions and knowledge of the local ecology, and improved iteratively until the final map met both the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; for environmental conditions and the historical assumptions developed by the experts. The final result was a possible four separate layers for each vegetation class (extent, size, color and density). Micro adjustments to vegetation extents and densities were made manually to improve the reliability in some areas, remove unintentional artifacts, and ease transitions between vegetation classes.&nbsp;</div>			<div class="number floatright">11</div>

		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Final renderings were created using VUE by e-on software, a natural landscape 3D rendering program with a procedural tree species library. We were able to acquire digital models for relevant tree species (e.g. live oak, coast redwood) that follow detailed rules for tree form to produce a realistic landscape rendering where no two trees are identical. As a 3D model, the landscape could then be rendered from any angle and at a very high resolution (the tree models include individual leaves, for example).</div>			<div class="number floatright">12</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Once complete, the rendering provided a hypothetical view into the past but comparing this view to present-day maps or air photos was more challenging than we anticipated. Comparing historic to present was enough of a visual disjuncture that viewers seemed to evaluate the reliability of the historical rendering in broad terms rather than focusing on specific areas of interest. We ultimately decided to develop a 3D model of the present-day conditions in a similar fashion so that viewers could directly compare the changes. The present-day model was developing using current GIS data, aerial imagery and photographs.</div>			<div class="number floatright">13</div>

None of the Spanish explorers traveled precisely through the study area although they did come tantalizingly close. On the 1769 expedition, Father Juan Crespi when arriving further north along San Francisquito Creek mentioned seeing what appear to be pines or &ldquo;<i>savins</i>&rdquo; (his word for redwoods) in the distance, as does geographer Miguel Costanso. Both men also take note of the extensive oaks in the area. In 1774, Captain Fernando Rivera also stopped at San Francisquito Creek, describing it as rising &ldquo;<i>from a small mountain range, covered with the [red-]wood</i>,&rdquo; with many &ldquo;<i>acorn-bearing live-oaks</i>&rdquo; nearby. Father Francisco Palou also wrote about camping at San Francisquito Creek, and noted it was lined with cottonwoods, willows, sycamores, laurels, brambles, additional species he could not identify and clumps of &ldquo;<i>very tall trees of a red-wood sort, and about a hundred paces farther down, another very large one of the same red-wood, which can be seen more than a league (2.6 miles) before crossing the creek and from afar looks like a tower.</i>&rdquo; In 1776, Father Pedro Font wrote about crossing San Francisquito Creek, &ldquo;<i>where a spruce-tree</i> [some of the Spanish referred to the redwoods as spruces or larches] <i>upon the bank was seen which, when measured by the graphometer, appeared to be fifty yards in height, and was five and a half</i> [yards] <i>in circumference at its foot.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp;</div>			<div class="number floatright">15</div>

Their journals also indicate there were several isolated stands, including below the site of the present-day dam along San Francisquito Creek extending down to the future site of Palo Alto. Later Rancho maps used redwoods as survey markers, indicating their presence but not their prevalence.<br><br>The transition from redwood-dominant forest to oak-chaparral-grassland vegetation types happened within the study area, although it is unclear where. There is some evidence that historic climate conditions were slightly cooler and wetter than today, with increased fogginess supportive of redwood growth.&nbsp;<br><br>Logging in the area began as early as 1777 with the establishment of Santa Clara Mission near San Jose and continued through the Mexican Period. Eventually, with the growth of San Francisco during the period of 1840s-1870s, logging all but eliminated redwoods from the study area and in much of the Santa Cruz Mountains.&nbsp;<br><br>Redwoods and other conifers present in the area today are second-growth stands less than 150 years old found near streams, on private property, and in the upper stretches of Dennis Martin Creek. A few isolated redwood trees are present below the dam.<br>A photograph looking up Dennis Martin Creek around 1900 shows no apparent evidence of redwood stumps, and mostly barren steep hillsides that have since been replaced by oak woodland.<br></div>			<div class="number floatright">20</div>

		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;"><p><b>Oak Woodland and Savanna</b></p>Due to their high nutritional value and abundance, acorns of the tanbark, blue, live and valley oak were a significant source of food for Native inhabitants of this area. Native grasses and other seed bearing plants were also important. Their land management practices would have been oriented toward supporting nut and seed production. Most significantly, these included burning woodland undergrowth to thin the woodland and understory shrubs, improve visibility, enable access, and to promote seedling growth.<br><br>With the arrival of the missions, oaks were a significant source of timber and were heavily logged throughout the 1800s, although less so than redwoods. The introduction of substantial grazing would have suppressed oak regeneration in the grassland communities and adjacent areas, sustaining the open oak savanna that had been previously maintained by fire.&nbsp;<br><br>In the last century with the absence of fire, logging, and (more recently) grazing. oaks have regrown to cover historical extents in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, residential areas, and in areas where there were previously redwood stands. Although it is difficult to determine the exact extent of oaks historically, it is assumed that they would have required similar site conditions as today&rsquo;s forest.&nbsp;<br><br>However, oak woodlands today are likely more homogenous with denser undergrowth than their historical structure. The historic woodlands and savanna likely had a more open canopy and varied tree ages, notably with older, larger trees. In open savanna areas, there were likely fewer trees overall as secondary shrub and seedling recruitment have filled out the prairie in the last century.</div>			<div class="number floatright">21</div>

These meandering channels would have likely supported a wide riparian zone along the current and historical stream tributaries.<br><br>Further upstream, Sausal Creek likely supported a broad riparian forest in flatter areas along the San Andreas Fault above where it joins the steeper Dennis Martin channel. Dennis Martin Creek, with its steep profile, would have had a narrow riparian belt but this would have spread out as the streams joined Alambique Creek.<br><br>Substantial erosion as a result of deforestation upstream and subsequent sedimentation since the dam construction has lowered all of the stream water profiles and promoted riparian and marshland vegetation, particularly along Alambique Creek and its confluence with Corte Madera.<br><br>Historically, the riparian forest structure would have been more varied with a more open canopy due to beaver activity and fire. The areas adjacent to streams were almost certainly logged over and used for irrigation and grazing in the 1800s. The recovered riparian forest is younger and dominated by moisture-tolerant species than it was historically.</div>			<div class="number floatright">22</div>

		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;"><p><b>Chaparral</b></p>In dense, woody stands, chaparral was generally undesirable for Native inhabitants who burned mature stands regularly to encourage herbs and forbs, improve mobility and support hunting. As chaparral is extremely flammable, these fires may have been difficult to control and could have charred broad areas before recovering from deep roots within 5-10 years. Areas that were burned repeatedly in short cycles could have been converted to grasslands.&nbsp;<br><br>Livestock grazing introduced in the 1800s would have contributed to keeping chaparral at bay on the edges of pastureland. Subsequently, chaparral would have been painstakingly removed to allow for cultivation of grain, vineyards and orchards. Chaparral and its roots could be sold for wood and charcoal, especially during the late 19th century boom.&nbsp;<br><br>In the last century with fire suppression and the reduction of grazing, chaparral has recovered in areas that were grazed or logged. Some areas may have been chaparral continuously since the 1700s as large uninhabitable areas are still noted on Stanford property in the late 1800s.&nbsp;<br><br>With such a varied history, it is difficult to assess the exact extent of historical chaparral at any given time compared to today, we can only presume similar site conditions and distribution.</div>			<div class="number floatright">23</div>

		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;"><p><b>Grassland</b></p>Historically, native grasslands were abundant in the study area, maintained through frequent burning from lightning- and human-caused fires and grazing by natural herbivores.&nbsp;<br><br>Native Americans burned grasslands and chaparral to enable mobility, encourage grass and seed production, drive game, and promote visibility. Frequent burning could have limited the extent of sagebrush and chaparral.&nbsp;<br><br>Significant grazing was introduced with ranching during the Mission and Mexican periods and later. Grazing suppressed chaparral and oak regrowth and favored the non-native grasses introduced by the Spanish. The area was also cultivated as grain fields, vineyards, and orchards, which were developed on existing grassland or cleared chaparral. In combination with the significant logging during the 1800s, by the time of the dam construction the area was mostly devoid of trees.&nbsp;<br><br>Livestock were active in Jasper Ridge until 1960 and in surrounding areas for longer. In the last half-century, especially with fire-suppression and the elimination of logging and grazing, oak woodlands, savanna, and chaparral have reclaimed significant parts of the landscape, reducing the extent of grasslands.&nbsp;<br><br>Areas adjacent to Searsville Lake and the tributaries of San Francisquito Creek have substantially recovered as dense wooded areas. Although non-native European grasses have replaced most of the native grasses, some areas still persist, principally on the high serpentine ridge to the east of the study area.</div>			<div class="number floatright">24</div>

Substantial sedimentation from Sausal, Dennis Martin, and Alambique Creeks above Searsville Lake has significantly modified the topography, transforming their stream profiles from moderate to very low. Their confluence now forms a wide, flat, marshy area surrounded by riparian forest.<br><br>The current wetland vegetation supports several aquatic and semi-aquatic species in a broad zone extending up to and beyond Portola Road to Upper Marsh. With strong seasonal stream flow patterns, these areas are typically dry during the summer and fall and moist during the winter and spring.<br><br>From historical maps we know of two ponds or marshes in the area, the largest being approximately the area west of Portola Road denoted as &ldquo;Lloyd&rsquo;s Pond.&rdquo; The marsh was drained by Alambique Creek and was adjacent to the town of Searsville, established in the 1860s but ultimately abandoned when the reservoir was filled.<br><br>Few if no other areas would have likely supported marshland communities, even at the major confluence of Alambique and Corte Madera Creeks at the end of the current reservoir.</div>			<div class="number floatright">25</div>

			<div class="header" style="margin-top:10fpx;padding-bottom:12px;">Comparative Analysis</div>			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Over two centuries, this landscape has been transformed many times over through resource extraction, destructive land use, residential development, hydrologic manipulation, and preservation. The 1891 dam had the most profound impact, creating the reservoir that has held back a century&rsquo;s worth of sediment and debris (see below), adding significant area to the aquatic and semi-aquatic habitat (see below). In other areas, land use and climate changes have likely reduced the area of grassland, eliminated lowland redwoods, and expanded the presence of chaparral and oak.</div>			<div class="number floatright">27</div>
