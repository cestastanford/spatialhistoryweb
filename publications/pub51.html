This website is no longer updated and has been replaced with a static copy. The <strong>Spatial History Project</strong> was active at Stanford University from 2007-2022, engaging in dozens of collaborative projects led by faculty, staff, graduate students, post-docs, visiting scholars and others at Stanford and beyond. More than 150 undergraduate students from more than a dozen disciplines contributed to these projects. In addition to a robust intellectual exchange built through these partnerships, research outputs included major monographs, edited volumes, journal articles, museum exhibitions, digital articles, robust websites, and dozens of lightweight interactive visualizations, mostly developed with Adobe Flash (now defunct). While most of those publications live on in other forms, the content exclusive to this website is preserved in good faith through this static version of the site. Flash-based content is partially available in emulated form using the Ruffle emulator.

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Because borders changed dramatically from 1938-1945, it is best to understand them dynamically. Although static maps are great resources for representing borders at specific points in time, they fail to capture change over time. A comprehensive database of WWII boundaries does not exist. This project seeks to represent WWII boundaries through an animation that demonstrates how borders changed over time. Through the use of ArcGIS and Flash animation, WWII borders can be presented dynamically and in greater depth than static mediums.    </div>			<div class="number floatright">4</div>

			<div class="header" style="margin-top:10fpx;padding-bottom:12px;">Historical Context</div>			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Dissatisfaction with interwar boundaries drove border changes during WWII. The interwar years, the period between the end of World War I and the beginning of WWII, was characterized by irredentism. Revisionist states, states which sought to erase the WWI settlement, included Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and the Soviet Union Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, and the Soviet Union, as losers of WWI, sought to reclaim land that had been stripped from them in their respective peace treaties. Bulgaria, a loser in the Balkan Wars, also wanted to regain territory it lost after the Second Balkan War. Italy, the lone revisionist state that had been a victor during the Great War, believed that it had not been amply compensated territorially for its WWI sacrifices and set out to build a modern Roman Empire.<a href="#footnote-2"><font color="red"><sup>2</sup></font></a>  </div>			<div class="number floatright">6</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Irredentism dominated the foreign policies of revisionist states and must be understood to study boundary changes during WWII. After the Treaty of Trianon, for example, Hungary lost two-thirds of its territory. This led to "the reduction of Hungary&rsquo;s population by half, confiscation of two-thirds of her railway, road and canal networks, together with about 80% of her forests and mines, and...the transfer of over three million ethnic Magyars to Czechoslovak, Romanian, Yugoslav, or Austrian rule."<a href="#footnote-3"><font color="red"><sup>3</sup></font></a> The day the treaty was signed, June 4, 1920, became a day of national mourning: stores and schools were closed, and Budapest was draped in black.<a href="#footnote-4"><font color="red"><sup>4</sup></font></a> Hungarian flags on government buildings were lowered to half-mast until 1938. Although Hungarian land had been taken away, Greater Hungary continued to exist in the Magyar imagination.<a href="#footnote-5"><font color="red"><sup>5</sup></font></a> Crowds rallied in support of reclaiming the lost territories and responded to questions about whether they would accept their losses with a resounding <i>"nem, nem, soha!"</i> (no, no, never!).<a href="#footnote-6"><font color="red"><sup>6</sup></font></a> In 1933, Count Istv&aacute;n Bethlen, the former Hungarian Prime Minister and member of Parliament, told a London crowd that</div>			<div class="number floatright">7</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Signaling the end of the interwar system, Germany annexed Austria in March 1938, an event known as the <i>Anschluss</i>. Eighteenth months later, the <i>Wehrmacht</i>, the German army, overran Poland, and for almost six years Axis armies set Europe on fire. As Axis armies pushed across the battlefields of Europe, Hitler created a New Order, one which would reverse the settlements of the Great War. Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia, countries which had been created by the Paris Peace Conference, were wiped from the map. The treaties of the WWI settlement were abrogated, and land was returned to the old Central Powers through both intimidation and force. At the height of the New Order in 1942, the area under Axis control extended from the Atlantic coast of France to the outskirts of Moscow and Stalingrad. </div>			<div class="number floatright">12</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Europe ceased to be a continent of sovereign nation-states and morphed into a confusing blend of sovereign states, occupied territories, and everything in between. The interwar international system was replaced with the New Order, facilitated by Germany largely for its own benefit. In addition to annexing territory, the Axis powers also established protectorates, designated for eventual incorporation into the mother country. These protectorates cannot neatly be categorized as occupied or annexed territories. In the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, German Reichsprotektor Reinhard Heydrich pushed for immediate deportation of undesirables and German colonization. The Nazis did enact Germanization in the Protectorate, using their "racial science" to determine the racially acceptable Czechs and bring them into German society.<a href="#footnote-12"><font color="red"><sup>12</sup></font></a> It was clear that Bohemia and Moravia would one day become part of Germany.

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">In a project which studies the nature of boundaries, defining what constitutes a boundary change is a critical issue. The first task was to classify conquered territories as annexed or occupied. Boundaries would only change because of annexations, both <i>de jure</i> and  <i>de facto</i>. The definition used was one which categorized territories by administration type: Axis civil administration, civil administration, and military administration.<a href="#footnote-13"><font color="red"><sup>13</sup></font></a> Territories which were classified as "under Axis civil administration" were considered annexed and warranted a change in boundaries. This category includes territories that were formally annexed (i.e. Wartheland), and those which were "increasingly treated as parts of the Reich, but had not yet been formally incorporated" (i.e. Bia&#322;ystok).<a href="#footnote-14"><font color="red"><sup>14</sup></font></a> Territories which were occupied and not incorporated or established as new entities did not have borders changed.<a href="#footnote-15"><font color="red"><sup>15</sup></font></a></div>			<div class="number floatright">16</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The database tracks border changes by month. The first month is February 1938, one month before the <i>Anschluss</i>. Because the <i>Anschluss</i> is widely seen as the first WWII event, February 1938 represents the interwar system. The goal of the project is to create accurate borders at the continental scale, roughly 1:10,000,000. For most regions, using a 1:350,000 scale during the digitization process was sufficient to accomplish this. For certain smaller regions, including Danzig and Prekmurje, it was necessary to use a smaller scale, 1:150,000. </div>			<div class="number floatright">17</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The best sources for digitizing boundaries during WWII are historic maps. When using maps as sources, however, it is important to analyze potential biases of the publisher. In an era with borders as complex and contentious as WWII, publishers presented Europe quite differently, reflecting national prejudices and the confusion of the period. In order to portray the situation on the ground and avoid national biases, maps for this project were used with caution. Since the Axis orchestrated and facilitated border changes, Axis maps, especially German, often depicted the changing situation in Europe most accurately. </div>			<div class="number floatright">18</div>

			<div class="header" style="margin-top:10fpx;padding-bottom:12px;">Challenges</div>			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Relying on historical maps for the project poses several challenges. The fact that Hungarians labeled their maps <i>Csonka Magyarorsz&aacute;g</i> (Mutilated Hungary) demonstrates that maps can be partial. The greater difficulty, however, is when cartographers use borders to show prejudice. Cartographers from occupied countries could use maps as propaganda, showing that forcible territorial annexations were both unpopular and unaccepted.<a href="#footnote-16"><font color="red"><sup>16</sup></font></a></div>			<div class="number floatright">19</div>

		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">
						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">A good example of national prejudice in maps is German and French depictions of Alsace-Lorraine (Elsa&szlig;-Lothringen) (Figure 3). The region, located in France at the time of the German invasion in May 1940, had traded hands twice in the previous seventy years, to Germany in the Franco-Prussian War, and back to France in WWI. The legitimacy of French rule over Alsace-Lorraine during the interwar years was hotly contested, and annexing the region was a German war aim during the invasion of France. After the fall of France, Alsace-Lorraine was reattached to Germany, the French business names and street signs were translated into German, and men of fighting age were conscripted into the <i>Wehrmacht</i>.<a href="#footnote-17"><font color="red"><sup>17</sup></font></a> German maps portrayed Alsace-Lorraine in the Reich thereafter. In the <i>Grossdeutsches Reich</i>, for example, drawn by the Viennese publishing house Freytag and Berndt in 1944, Alsace-Lorraine is shown to be within Greater Germany. In contrast, French cartographers continued to depict Alsace-Lorraine in France. The Parisian publishing house Girard and Barr&egrave;re, for example, printed its 1942 map of France with the region still in France.  Here the maps are used as nationalist propaganda. The Girard and Barr&egrave;re map is a good source for presenting the French perspective about the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, but is not a good source for reflecting the situation on the ground.</div>			<div class="number floatright">20</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Classifying territories was a challenge because the difference between annexed and occupied land was not always obvious. It was clear that revisionist states would annex territory where it had an ethnic majority. In Yugoslav Macedonia, for example, the Bulgarian government treated the population, mainly Bulgarian, "as a liberated extension of Bulgaria-legislatively, administratively, militarily, educationally, linguistically, and ecclesiastically."<a href="#footnote-18"><font color="red"><sup>18</sup></font></a> The population in Yugoslav Macedonia welcomed the annexation, bringing ethnic Bulgarians under control of Sofia and ending two decades of Serbianization.<a href="#footnote-19"><font color="red"><sup>19</sup></font></a>  </div>			<div class="number floatright">22</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">In territories in which the revisionists did not have an ethnic majority, however, the distinction between occupied and annexed territory was not nearly as clear. Bia&#322;ystok (Belostok) is one such territory. Located in prewar Poland, it fell into German hands after the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Two months later, Bia&#322;ystok was attached to East Prussia in an effort to link the Reich to Ukraine.<a href="#footnote-20"><font color="red"><sup>20</sup></font></a> Although under the German civil administration, it was not formally incorporated into the Reich.<a href="#footnote-21"><font color="red"><sup>21</sup></font></a> Territories like Bia&#322;ystok do not fall neatly into either of the "annexed" or "occupied" categories, but must to be classified nonetheless.  </div>			<div class="number floatright">23</div>

Although each differed on racial policies and had varying levels of ambition, all could agree on border revisionism. As confirmed by the literature published on the subject, this visualization demonstrates that WWII was primarily an Eastern European experience. Historians often point to death tolls to show this. Tony Judt documents that one in five Poles was killed during the war, one in eight Yugoslavs, one in eleven Soviets, and one in fourteen Greeks. In contrast, Western Europeans suffered deaths at a much lower rate, as France lost 1 in 77 and Britain 1 in 125.<a href="#footnote-22"><font color="red"><sup>22</sup></font></a> Border revisions also suggest that WWII was an Eastern European experience. 94% of the land Germany annexed, for example, was in Eastern Europe. In addition, it also shows that they occurred at the beginning of the war, and by 1942 the New Order had been firmly established. Although Italy occupied land in Western Europe (southwest regions of France), it only annexed territory in Yugoslavia and Greece. Because of geography, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and the Soviet Union also only annexed land in Eastern Europe.  It is also clear that border revisions were closely associated with fronts.</div>			<div class="number floatright">25</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Not only were Eastern European borders changed at a much higher rate than Western European, but many regions in the East were annexed multiple times (Figure 5). Vilnius (Wilno), long disputed among Lithuanians, Poles, and Russians, actually changed hands four times during the war.<a href="#footnote-23"><font color="red"><sup>23</sup></font></a> Teschen (Cieszyn, T&#283;�&iacute;n), a region located in prewar Czechoslovakia, was transferred to Poland in October 1938 and was later annexed by Germany after the fall of Poland. Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia shuffled between Romania and the Soviet Union in a tug-of-war match, finally landing with the Soviet Union in summer 1944. The Baltic States also experienced multiple annexations, going from being independent to becoming integrated into the Soviet Union in summer 1940, then to the Reichskommissariat Ostland one year later, and finally back to the Soviet Union after being liberated (or conquered, depending on perspective). The visualization suggests that the territories which changed hands the most clustered in the eastern half of prewar Poland and the Baltic States. This is unsurprising because these regions were coveted by two major powers (Germany and the Soviet Union), as well as nationalist movements (Polish, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian). This is in striking comparison to Western Europe. The visualization demonstrates that only one Western European territory, southern France, changed government more than once. And this part of France was even under French (albeit Vichy French) jurisdiction for two years. </div>			<div class="number floatright">27</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Although revisionist countries attempted to reclaim lands lost during WWI, they had varying levels of success (Figure 6). Germany, with its far-reaching goals for the war, easily surpassed its land total for WWI. At the height of the New Order in 1942, Germany had added over 270,000 square kilometers, a landmass almost the size of prewar Romania. Bulgaria, too, was successful in exceeding its WWI status, adding about 52,000 square kilometers. Of the three Central Powers, only Hungary did not exceed its WWI total (though it did increase in size by about 85%). Romania, often seen as the big winner of the WWI settlement, was naturally the big loser at the zenith of the New Order. Both Hungary and the Soviet Union took back large chunks of territory from Romania&rsquo;s WWI gains.</div>			<div class="number floatright">29</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The land totals for the postwar period reveal some interesting trends. The fact that the Soviet Union gained 476,000 square kilometers (a landmass bigger than prewar Germany) is expected because the Soviet Union was an occupying power after the war and had the leverage to impose its will in Eastern Europe. Also, it should be expected that Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Romania lost land because they were Axis powers. What is striking, however, is the fact that Bulgaria, a marginal Axis power, actually <i>gained</i> land: it had to return the Greek and Yugoslav land it had seized, but was allowed to keep Southern Dobruja from Romania. The Soviets never acted on any territorial ambitions in Bulgaria; this can be attributed to the close relationship between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union.</div>			<div class="number floatright">31</div>

			<div class="header" style="margin-top:10fpx;padding-bottom:12px;">Conclusion</div>			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">European borders have largely remained static since the end of WWII. Although the American and Soviet influences during the Cold War and the rise of the European Union have played major roles in ensuring border stability, some credit needs to be given to the fact that European countries have become relatively ethnically homogenous. This was done through a wave of deportations and population exchanges at the end of WWII. Almost three million ethnic Germans were expelled from the Sudetenland to Germany.<a href="#footnote-24"><font color="red"><sup>24</sup></font></a> In February 1946 Czechoslovakia and Hungary agreed to transfer 120,000 Slovaks living in Hungary to Czechoslovakia, and 120,000 Hungarians in Slovakia were transferred to Hungary.<a href="#footnote-25"><font color="red"><sup>25</sup></font></a> Although the Potsdam Declaration dictated that transfers "should be effected in an orderly and humane manner," the transfers were violent.<a href="#footnote-26"><font color="red"><sup>26</sup></font></a> The exchanges, while undertaken with considerable hostility and death tolls, led to ethnically homogenous states by 1947, with the exceptions of Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. After the mass expulsions, less than 3% of Europe was considered a national minority.<a href="#footnote-27"><font color="red"><sup>27</sup></font></a> As Judt argues, "a new, &rsquo;tidier&rsquo; Europe was being born."<a href="#footnote-28"><font color="red"><sup>28</sup></font></a> Czechoslovakia too followed the trend, and Czechoslovakia divided into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in January 1993.<a href="#footnote-29"><font color="red"><sup>29</sup></font></a> Yugoslavia has been engulfed in civil war, still unable to solve the conflicts that first became violent during WWII. The trend is that homogenous states, something Europe certainly did not have during WWII, facilitate peace. It is no coincidence that the former Yugoslavia, the most ethnically heterogeneous region in Europe, has seen the most violence on the European continent since WWII.   </div>			<div class="number floatright">32</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">One of the major causes of WWII was discontent with interwar borders. Revisionist states sought to protect their national minorities abroad. Although the League of Nations was committed to protecting the rights of minorities during the interwar years, revisionist states could not accept anything less than border modifications. This was no small issue: after all, 32,000,000 Europeans were classified as "minorities" during the interwar years.<a href="#footnote-30"><font color="red"><sup>30</sup></font></a> The Axis powers sought to eliminate the minority issue and bring their own people under their own control. Although the Allies prevailed, the result of WWII was the establishment of homogeneous states. The revisionist powers&rsquo; goal was achieved. </div>			<div class="number floatright">33</div>
