This website is no longer updated and has been replaced with a static copy. The <strong>Spatial History Project</strong> was active at Stanford University from 2007-2022, engaging in dozens of collaborative projects led by faculty, staff, graduate students, post-docs, visiting scholars and others at Stanford and beyond. More than 150 undergraduate students from more than a dozen disciplines contributed to these projects. In addition to a robust intellectual exchange built through these partnerships, research outputs included major monographs, edited volumes, journal articles, museum exhibitions, digital articles, robust websites, and dozens of lightweight interactive visualizations, mostly developed with Adobe Flash (now defunct). While most of those publications live on in other forms, the content exclusive to this website is preserved in good faith through this static version of the site.

			<div class="header" style="margin-top:10fpx;padding-bottom:12px;">The Urban Animal</div>			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">On a visit to New York City in 1842, Charles Dickens sketched a lively street scene on Broadway: the fashionable and well-to-do strolling up and down the wide streets, &ldquo;ladies in bright colors walking to and fro, in pair and singly,&rdquo; one with a blue parasol who &ldquo;passed and repassed the hotel-window twenty times while we were sitting there.&rdquo;<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>2</sup></font></a>  </div>			<div class="number floatright">2</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">For much of the nineteenth century, American cities were ecologically diverse places, invariably made up of a multitude of domesticated and semi-domesticated species, including humans. But by the twentieth century that diversity was in decline, as people segregated and separated animals used for food production from growing commercial and residential downtowns. This new spatial separation between humans and certain animals transformed human-animal relationships, and the emerging paradigm fundamentally changed how people thought of their world. We continue to grapple with the consequences of that separation today, the contours and ramifications of which scholars have only begun to explore.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>4</sup></font></a>  </div>			<div class="number floatright">4</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">During much of the nineteenth century, people in cities needed animals, even if their physical presence was at times offensive and unpleasant. Many urban residents kept pigs, who foraged the city streets by day before returning home each night for food scraps and shelter. For the poor, in particular, scavenger pigs were an inexpensive source of meat. Hog cart riots were common occurrences in New York City in the late 1820s and 1830s, as residents rebelled against city efforts to impound free-roaming pigs.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>5</sup></font></a>  By 1842, the year Charles Dickens visited New York, pigs still maintained a conspicuous presence in that city.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>6</sup></font></a>  </div>			<div class="number floatright">5</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Though pigs were less common in nineteenth century San Francisco, early accounts describe a multitude of species within the city. &ldquo;The spaces separating these houses are filled with domestic animals,&rdquo; wrote French journalist Etienne Derbec in the early years of the Gold Rush, &ldquo;Horses, mules, sows, pigs, chickens live in freedom in these unusual sections [of town], and you, sir, can imagine all the inconveniences such a population brings in its train: one&rsquo;s sense of smell and of hearing are, as you can well believe, somewhat offended.&rdquo;<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>7</sup></font></a> </div>			<div class="number floatright">6</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The advent of railroads, wire communication and to so some extent refrigeration, changed the spatial possibilities of human-animal interactions. Railroads transformed spatial relations, making a seemingly distant area by human scale (out of sight, scent and sound) relatively close by a new industrial scale (the flow of capital, and the rapid movement of information and goods). A trip from the city&rsquo;s outskirts to downtown markets by rail required a fraction of the time and cost it once did. Wire communication meant that a decision made in downtown San Francisco by someone on the stock market floor could be effected immediately by someone miles away on the kill floor. If distance were measured in terms of time spent and spoilage of goods, railroads caused a dramatic shrinkage of space. Later in the century, industrial use of ice and refrigeration had the effect of further collapsing distance and slowing time. Suddenly it was possible to ship regularly, quickly and inexpensively from hinterlands and outskirts to urban markets.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>8</sup></font></a>  </div>			<div class="number floatright">7</div>

		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">
						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Just as railroads created new connections between city and hinterlands&mdash;an urban center that magnetically pulled natural resources to concentrated markets&mdash;so also did railroads offer new opportunities to push away unwanted spaces. Railroads both connected and separated, creating an urban-periphery relationship that simultaneously pushed and pulled across the very same sets of tracks. Cities, including San Francisco, used this new spatial scenario as a regulatory tool. </div>			<div class="number floatright">8</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">In the remade landscape of a post-railroad world, the coexistence&mdash;often unpleasant&mdash;of animals and people in cities was no longer a necessary evil. Cities all over the world soon started exporting their noxious trades&mdash;chief among them slaughterhouses. One of the first things many cities did upon establishing a railroad was to export the messy process of killing and processing animals.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>9</sup></font></a> </div>			<div class="number floatright">9</div>

			<div class="header" style="margin-top:10fpx;padding-bottom:12px;">The Case of San Francisco</div>			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The case of San Francisco offers an interesting example of this spatial transformation of meat production in the late nineteenth century. Using city directories and insurance maps to determine the locations of slaughterhouses and retail butcher shops&mdash;then mapping those places using GIS&mdash;we are able to see surprising spatial trends in meat production and distribution in the last decades of the nineteenth century. These trends would not be visible without using digital tools to breathe life into old documents.</div>			<div class="number floatright">10</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The 1860 directory listings did not distinguish between retail and wholesale operations. But that lack of distinction is itself significant. The categories &ldquo;wholesale butcher&rdquo; and &ldquo;retail butcher&rdquo; did not exist in the Langley City Directory until 1869&mdash;immediately after the city forced slaughterhouses from downtown by law. Until that separation, many butchers practiced a long-established craft in which they knew and often participated in the entire process of turning a live animal into a piece of meat. Henry Miller, who would go on to found Miller & Lux, the cattle and land giant of the West, originally came to San Francisco as a butcher. Like many San Francisco butchers in the 1850s, Miller was German-born, the son of a butcher, and trained in a traditional craft of butchering. </div>			<div class="number floatright">13</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Miller came to San Francisco in 1850 and described the trade at that time as having a rough, but not rigid, spatial organization&mdash;an organization based largely on environmental features. At one of his first jobs in the 1850s, Miller remembered taking a cart from his boss&rsquo;s shop to the slaughterhouse, located at the far northern edge of the city &ldquo;at the head of Dupont Street [today Grant Street] down near the bay. &rdquo; Later in the same decade, Miller owned a shop and a slaughterhouse on the corner of Fifth and Howard Streets. <a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>11</sup></font></a></div>			<div class="number floatright">14</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Though today well inland, Fifth Street at Howard was, according to historical maps, adjacent to tidal marshes that have since been filled and developed. Although both of the slaughterhouses Miller mentioned were distant from each other, they both shared a close proximity to water&mdash;a natural sink&mdash;as well as a notable distance from downtown settlements. In fact, when we remove butchers whose addresses were market stalls (an unlikely place for animal slaughter), our map looks significantly different, and we can begin to detect a loose organization of butchers and slaughterhouses along the periphery of downtown settlements.</div>			<div class="number floatright">15</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The 1860 addresses (again, not yet sub-categorized in the directory into wholesale and retail) show a somewhat remote cluster of butchers south of downtown, along Mission Creek. At the time this area was known informally as &ldquo;butchertown,&rdquo; and later (and from here forward in this paper) referred to as &ldquo;Old Butchertown&rdquo; (See Figure 2). &ldquo;Old Butchertown&rdquo; was made up of small-scale slaughterhouses, along the shores of the &ldquo;sluggish waters Mission Creek. &rdquo;<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>12</sup></font></a> But, given the fact that only nine of the twenty wholesale butchers listed in 1869 were located in &ldquo;Old Butchertown,&rdquo; it seems likely that it was not the only place in the city where animals were slaughtered.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>13</sup></font></a></div>			<div class="number floatright">17</div>

			<div class="header" style="margin-top:10fpx;padding-bottom:12px;">The Push on Slaughter</div>			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The city would focus its first wave of new spatial regulations on &ldquo;Old Butchertown, &rdquo; and the slow, crimson creek that carried offal and blood to the Bay. Mission Creek did that work for years, until the accumulated and perpetual volume of bloody waste overtook the limited cleansing power the creek once held. Mission creek was no longer sufficient&mdash;both in its relationship to expanding residential settlement, and also in its capacity as an environmental sink facing the needs of a large and growing population.  </div>			<div class="number floatright">18</div>

		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">
						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Perhaps no American place grew as quickly into a major city as San Francisco in the nineteenth century. From 1860 to 1870 the city&rsquo;s population increased by over 90,000 people&mdash;more than any other decade in its history besides the 1920s. As a percentage increase, the population tripled in the 1860s. By 1870, San Francisco was the tenth largest city in the United States. <a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>14</sup></font></a></div>			<div class="number floatright">19</div>

		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">
						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The new human pressures on the city&rsquo;s environment in the 1860s were extraordinary. In 1866, the city&rsquo;s Health Officer, J.M. McNulty, surveyed the sanitary situation, and expressed particular concern for &ldquo;the close proximity of the Slaughter Houses and Hog Ranches to the City, &rdquo; and their &ldquo;great nuisance... so long as they remain in the present locality. &rdquo; <a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>15</sup></font></a>  Two years later, in 1868, the problem persisted, and the Health Officer reported that the slaughterhouses located on the &ldquo;sluggish waters of Mission creek, &rdquo; required &ldquo;two or three tides to carry the offal to the bay, where a great portion of it drifts in on our irregular water front, putrefying in the sun, and sending up its pestilential gases, poisoning the atmosphere of our city, and causing disease wherever it abounds. &rdquo; <a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>16</sup></font></a> Human activities of this booming city were rapidly outpacing the natural sink that was Mission Creek.</div>			<div class="number floatright">20</div>

		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">
						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">In addition to creating more waste, population growth also meant competition for space; the growing spheres of residential and noxious space clashed with greater frequency and intensity. In particular, the area south of Market Street, just north of &ldquo;Old Butchertown&rdquo; underwent rapid settlement in the 1860s. One factor in the development south of Market Street was the lapse in the city franchise on several toll roads in the 1860s, which opened Mission and Folsom Streets to greater traffic and development, and presumably made them more appealing to residential settlement. <a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>17</sup></font></a> </div>			<div class="number floatright">21</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Geography had some influence on settlement patterns as well, with steep hills to the west of downtown limiting settlement, compared to the flat lowlands south of Market Street. It was soon clear, however, that the city&rsquo;s growth made slaughterhouses in &ldquo;Old Butchertown&rdquo; &mdash;now only a few blocks south of the settlements south of Market Street&mdash;a permanent nuisance to the growing number of residential neighbors. What ensued was a turf war between competing aesthetics of space&mdash;a conflict between increasingly refined residential space and the new concentration and volume of urban waste. Residents complained about the stench and foulness in what one newspaper called a &ldquo;war of the citizens on the butchers.&rdquo;<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>18</sup></font></a>  </div>			<div class="number floatright">22</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Inseparable from the stench of slaughter were health concerns that put additional pressure on the movement of slaughterhouses. The smell of rotting flesh was not merely unpleasant, but miasmatic theories held that those odors were unhealthy, even deadly. Further, new scientific evidence increasingly suggested that environments, and not God or an individual&rsquo;s impiety, caused sickness and disease. By the 1860s, disease was not simply the fault of an individual, but a social and environmental problem that could be solved by altering one&rsquo;s surroundings. These ideas provided a stronger impetus for urban environmental reform.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>19</sup></font></a> </div>			<div class="number floatright">24</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Public health was a powerful force in nineteenth century municipal politics. City governments often took seriously their task of protecting public welfare through a &ldquo;well regulated society&rdquo; under two common law maxims: <i>salus populi suprema lex est</i> (the welfare of the people is the supreme law), and <i>sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas</i> (use your own so as not to injure another). <a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>20</sup></font></a> Slaughterhouse regulation fell under the &ldquo;Health Officer &rsquo;s Report&rdquo; in the city&rsquo;s Annual Reports. By 1865 the San Francisco Department of Health was a powerful arm of city hall. Its muscle was the common law, which would enable the department&rsquo;s rapid development in the decades that followed.</div>			<div class="number floatright">25</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Slaughterhouses were not the only urban feature pushed toward the city&rsquo;s outskirts. At the same time San Francisco started exporting slaughter, they also began exporting their dead. In 1868 the city exhumed bodies in cemeteries downtown and relocated them to the uninhabited &ldquo;Outside Lands&rdquo; &mdash;a windy and desolate collection sand dunes far west of the lively downtown. It was both fear of disease and the unremitting demand for residential urban space for the living that pushed cemeteries to the periphery&mdash;pressures not entirely different from those exerted on &ldquo;Old Butchertown. &rdquo; <a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>21</sup></font></a></div>			<div class="number floatright">26</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">But slaughterhouses were held in space by a slightly different set of forces. Urban residents wanted them farther away than they actually were, but those same residents relied upon their close proximity. The railroad changed those spatial tensions&mdash;the pushes and pulls&mdash;holding slaughterhouses in place, effectively weakening the forces (spoilage and cost) that kept slaughter close. Slaughterhouses and other noxious trades, once spatially situated near the places they serviced, could now be connected to the city from farther away. It was possible enjoy a meal without smelling, seeing, or hearing the process of turning animals into food. </div>			<div class="number floatright">27</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">In the late 1860s, San Francisco passed a series of laws that first banned slaughter from certain parts of the city, and ultimately established a particular, finite space for killing and keeping of animals that would become known as Butchertown. The initial push on slaughterhouses was accompanied by a &ldquo;pull&rdquo; from the southern shores of the city, a place that would become new Butchertown. The result was the consolidation of unwanted space, &ldquo;Butchertown, &rdquo; that was a piece of a larger separation and compartmentalization of the urban periphery.</div>			<div class="number floatright">28</div>

The name of the grant was &ldquo;Rincon de las Salinas y Potrero de Viejo&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;the corner of the salt marsh and the old grazing land. &rdquo; The area had several key characteristics that made it stand out as potential slaughterhouse space. First, it was a place with little or no residential settlement and far from the growing residential areas of downtown. Second, it was a space recently connected to downtown by railroad and bridge, and thus pulled into economic orbit of the rapidly growing urban market. Third, it offered specific natural features that, in the eyes of nineteenth century planners, made it suitable for slaughterhouses. </div>			<div class="number floatright">29</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Though San Francisco&rsquo;s slaughterhouse district was somewhat distinctive for its tidal sink (most other cities had rivers), Butchertown was hardly unique. Specialized slaughterhouse space was an increasingly common feature of industrializing cities around the world. These places tended to have three key features: a new railroad, separation from downtown, and flowing water. Chicago, New Orleans, Paris, Berlin, and many other cities saw the emergence of similar versions of slaughterhouse space at around the same as San Francisco, though the forces in their creation might have varied. <a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>23</sup></font></a> It seems likely that cities shared and borrowed knowledge to create these spaces. They were a specific type of space produced at a historical moment&mdash;the confluence of ideas of health and sanitation, urban population booms, and new spatial relationships made possible by the railroad.</div>			<div class="number floatright">32</div>

Violators faced a fine of $20 to $500 and between twenty-five days and six months of prison for every infraction. Based on addresses, it would seem that wholesale butchers would take a few years to make the full transition to Butchertown, but the city no doubt came to enforce the new law. In 1867, one butcher challenged the law&rsquo;s enforcement in an appeal that reached the California Supreme Court, and which ultimately upheld the legitimacy of Butchertown in <i>Ex Parte Shrader</i>. <a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>24</sup></font></a> Spatial regulation of nuisances&mdash;particularly the regulation of something as noxious as slaughterhouses&mdash;was clearly within the rights of the city of San Francisco. An individual&rsquo;s ownership of his own labor was not absolute; in the name of public welfare it could have spatial limitations. The urgency and widespread legitimacy of slaughterhouse regulation in the 1860s perhaps adds new context to the Slaughterhouse Cases that the Supreme Court would hear only several years later. <a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>25</sup></font></a> One overlooked outcome of that important case was that it allowed cities to continue regulation of slaughterhouses under long-established precedent.</div>			<div class="number floatright">33</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Space and separation, then, intensified a new bureaucratization of the meat industry in San Francisco in the late nineteenth century. As butchers split their operations&mdash;to at once maintain their connections to downtown and Butchertown&mdash;so also did a split in the structure of their organizations emerge. In city directories, wholesale butchers increasingly listed their &ldquo;offices,&rdquo; which were not located at food markets, but rather in the financial district. Many butchers, like Henry Miller, turned in their bloody aprons for business suits, and went to work with bankers and brokers. <a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>28</sup></font></a> The fashionable and well-to-do still mixed with animals downtown, as they had in Dickens&rsquo;s time, though the physical connection between people and animals gave way to a more abstract relationship of commodification.</div>			<div class="number floatright">40</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Mapping retail butchers shows their geographic expansion over time. But by mapping density, as shown in figure 8, we see a more important change in distribution. Though the number of retail shops in 1871 (244) increased only to 322 in 1886 and 299 in 1901, the distribution of those shops became more evenly spread across the city. No longer concentrated in specialized niches downtown (often market stalls), butcher shops spread across the city as stores in residential neighborhoods. No longer confined to downtown markets, meat hung in the windows of neighborhood stores, becoming integrated into the urban landscape. While certain living animals were becoming less a part of people&rsquo;s lives, meat was increasingly imbedded in the everyday experience of city folk. <a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>29</sup></font></a></div>			<div class="number floatright">43</div>

If there was, in fact, a decline in the number of butchers working out of market stalls, as the data suggests, what explains this apparent exodus from markets and into neighborhood shops? Was this new spatial organization connected to the creation of Butchertown and the parallel spatial transformation of the wholesale industry? Did the spatial changes in retail butcher shops have something to do with improved refrigeration and means of distribution?  Furthermore, what were the consequences of this change? What did it mean socially that people increasingly shopped for meat at stores and not centralized markets?

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">As certain species were banned from cities, the diversity of people&rsquo;s physical relationships with animals narrowed to mostly horses and dogs as transportation and pets&mdash;relationships qualitatively different than animal husbandry.

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The new separation was not random, however, and represented an attempt by cities to separate, concentrate, and order marginal or peripheral space. Slaughterhouses joined tanneries and cemeteries, and other types of spaces urban residents no longer wanted or needed close by. They were spatial diasporas that marked a new ordering of space. In many ways, this structuring of the periphery was shaped by environmental and democratic factors, effected by residential desires for a cleaner, healthier and more pleasant place to live.</div>			<div class="number floatright">56</div>

Their influence on this paper is greatly appreciated, and far greater than the footnotes would indicate.  Thank you to the Spatial History Lab team, especially Kathy Harris and Whitney Berry. David Rumsey&rsquo;s website, <a href="http://www.davidrumsey.com">http://www.davidrumsey.com</a>, provided digitized historical maps used throughout. His commitment to making those maps free and easy to use online has been an enormous asset to this and other projects.</p><br />
