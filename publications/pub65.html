This website is no longer updated and has been replaced with a static copy. The <strong>Spatial History Project</strong> was active at Stanford University from 2007-2022, engaging in dozens of collaborative projects led by faculty, staff, graduate students, post-docs, visiting scholars and others at Stanford and beyond. More than 150 undergraduate students from more than a dozen disciplines contributed to these projects. In addition to a robust intellectual exchange built through these partnerships, research outputs included major monographs, edited volumes, journal articles, museum exhibitions, digital articles, robust websites, and dozens of lightweight interactive visualizations, mostly developed with Adobe Flash (now defunct). While most of those publications live on in other forms, the content exclusive to this website is preserved in good faith through this static version of the site. Flash-based content is partially available in emulated form using the Ruffle emulator.

			<div class="abstract floatleft" style="width:590px;letter-spacing:0.04em;">Although there is an extensive literature on railroad accidents, virtually all of it looks at the frequency of accidents according to occupation.   Attention to spatial distribution is rarer and coarse grained:  by state or by region.  Statistics compiled by the Colorado Railroad Commissioner, however, allow a more detailed study of accidents.  We can examine not only occupational distribution, but also spatial and seasonal distribution.
<p></p>
The most common source of railroad injuries was track construction or repair; the highest number of severe injuries occurred while coupling; and the largest number of deaths were caused by fragile human bodies meeting moving objects.  Severe accidents happened more often in the eastern part of the state, although there were more deaths in western Colorado.  The changing number of workers and work required at each station, 1890 city populations, the prevalence of medical assistance, and the ongoing construction of Colorado railroad track all provide potential clues to this distribution of accidents.</div>

			<div class="header" style="margin-top:10fpx;padding-bottom:12px;">Introduction</div>			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">On November 12, 1884, F. C. Smith was working for the Denver and Boulder Valley Railway Company as a railroad brakeman.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>1</sup></font></a>  As part of his duties, he routinely coupled and uncoupled railcars at different stopping points along the line.  On this particular day, he was working at Canfield, Colorado, and things did not go according to plan.  Nineteenth-century couplers came in a variety of not always compatible shapes and styles, and brakemen often had to use their hands to force the mechanisms together.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>2</sup></font></a>  A failure to move quickly or simple bad luck could cost a man a hand or a finger.  In Smith&#39;s case, the coupler cut off the middle finger on his right hand.  Two months before Smith&#39;s accident, George W. Prince, a brakeman on the Denver and Rio Grande Railway, had lost two of his fingers on a bridge in Colorado doing the same work.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>3</sup></font></a>  A month after Smith lost his finger, T. Conway, also a brakeman on the Denver and Rio Grande, had his fingers mashed and rendered useless at Montrose, Colorado while coupling.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>4</sup></font></a>  These were everyday accidents exacting their quotidian toll for the brakemen working on nineteenth-century railroads.  Lost fingers did not end careers.  They became the mark of a brakeman; you could recognize one by their missing fingers.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>5</sup></font></a>  Considering the fact that one out of every 120 trainmen&mdash;a railroad category that mostly included brakemen&mdash;died on the job each year, it is not surprising that the majority of trainmen considered the loss of a finger to be a "minor" injury.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>6</sup></font></a> </div>			<div class="number floatright">2</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">But brakemen were not the only workers hurt during this year&mdash;all together, 275 distinct employee accidents and fatalities were recorded in Colorado from July 1884 to June 1885.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>7</sup></font></a>  Although trainmen, and brakemen in particular, were the most prone to injury and death, working on the railroad was dangerous regardless of the job.  The railroad became the “most profound technological innovation” of the nineteenth-century and the “single largest American industry” by 1900, but at a great cost.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>8</sup></font></a>  By 1907, statistics stated that almost 12,000 men had died per year since the founding of the railroad industry.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>9</sup></font></a></div>			<div class="number floatright">3</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">While it is certainly useful (and lamentable) to know that one out of every 156 trainmen died while working on the railroad in the year ending June 30, 1894, these sorts of statistics alone cannot tell the entire history of nineteenth-century railroad accidents.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>11</sup></font></a>  Very little literature focuses on examining railroad accidents in terms of where they occurred geographically.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>12</sup></font></a>  In fact, the only geographic information consistently provided by the contemporary literature is that railroad workers were injured at higher rates both within and in close proximity to division points, which had high traffic and train maintenance facilities.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>13</sup></font></a>  The Colorado data provides an opportunity to extend the existing analyses by examining a case-study of accidents in Colorado from July 1884 to June 1885.</div>			<div class="number floatright">5</div>

			<div class="header" style="margin-top:10fpx;padding-bottom:12px;">Methodology</div>			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The Colorado Railroad Commissioner&#39;s Annual Report is an excellent source for a spatial historical analysis because it was one of the few state railroad reports to list railroad accidents by location.  The railroad annual reports also stated the name of each individual hurt, whether they were injured or killed, how the injury happened, which body part was hurt and the extent of the injury, and the company for which they worked.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>14</sup></font></a></div>			<div class="number floatright">6</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The methodology described in this publication, and in the ensuing analysis, involved some critical assumptions.  First, although the station revenue and number of tons forwarded examined in this paper are from the 1885 fiscal year, they have also been applied to the six months of accidents that occurred in the second half of 1884.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>18</sup></font></a>  Second, division points&mdash;stations that had large railroad yards, roundhouses, and numbers of workers who rearranged railcars and that can best be described as railroad “hubs”&mdash;could not be found through primary sources and have instead been determined to be the cities in which switchmen, the men in charge of coupling and uncoupling cars at railroad hubs, had accidents.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>19</sup></font></a>  These five cities in Colorado were Denver, Pueblo, La Junta, Salida, and Starkville.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>20</sup></font></a>  Finally, and most importantly, high amounts of tons forwarded and revenue imply that a station had more traffic passing through it, which in turn implies that there were more railroad workers stationed there in order to handle the larger workload.</div>			<div class="number floatright">9</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The most accident-prone areas, at least in terms of sheer numbers, were the largest division points with railroad yards.  Denver, Pueblo, and La Junta accounted for over a quarter of the total number of reported accidents.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>22</sup></font></a>  This is to be expected&mdash;the railroad yards had railroad roundhouses, where locomotive repair workers, such as David Cashier, could be injured in addition to the men regularly hurt working in the yards and along the tracks.</div>			<div class="number floatright">12</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<div class="autoheight" style="width:700px;padding-bottom:12px;">
						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">In addition, the railroad division points had more work on a day-to-day basis and required more workers.  Although no data is available on how much work employees did at each station and how many worked there, the total revenue earned and the amount of freight forwarded from each station provide a surrogate with higher numbers implying that more railroad employees worked at that station in order to handle the higher workload.  The data could be reflecting the fact that areas with a higher concentration of employees had more accidents.  The following scatter plot shows a positive correlation (r=.896, r<sup>2</sup>=.803) between total station revenue and the number of tons forwarded from the corresponding station.</div>			<div class="number floatright">13</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">There is also a connection between the distribution of accidents and city population.  The eastern half of the state, as defined by the railroad line connecting Stout and Denver to Pueblo and Starkville, had more accidents than the western half.  This could be due to higher population levels in the eastern part of the state and the ensuing higher railroad traffic due to the greater demand for goods.  For the year between July 1884 and June 1885, it was the amount of traffic rather than the difficulty of terrain that led to accidents.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>23</sup></font></a>  The following map shows the 1890 population of Colorado cities.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>24</sup></font></a></div>			<div class="number floatright">15</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The majority of the “severe” accidents happened in the eastern half of Colorado.  A great portion of these occurred at the three largest division points&mdash;Denver, Pueblo, and La Junta&mdash;an indication that these were coupling accidents that cost workers hands and fingers.  Unlike Denver and Pueblo, however, La Junta did not have any deadly accidents.  While this could be evidence that the station&#39;s workers were fortunate during this year, it could also be the result of having quicker medical attention for whatever injuries did occur from the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway&#39;s railroad hospital located at La Junta.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>29</sup></font></a>  Deaths may have been prevented by quick treatment of severe injuries.</div>			<div class="number floatright">19</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">The opposite appears to be true in western Colorado.  Railroad workers who were hurt in the western half of the state would not have been able to get medical attention as quickly as their larger city cohorts who had better access to hospitals, medical professionals, and more people in general.  As a result, western Colorado injuries that would have been classified as minor or moderate at their onset could have become severe or deadly by the time that medical attention became available.  This could account for the higher number of deaths in the western part of the state.</div>			<div class="number floatright">20</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Another explanation for the higher number of deaths in western Colorado could be the growth of the railroad.  From 1885 to 1893, the western half of Colorado rapidly expanded its miles of railroad track.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>30</sup></font></a>  Out of the eleven fatal accidents that occurred in western Colorado during this year, five involved section laborers and brakemen working on areas of the track that would be expanded by 1893.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>31</sup></font></a>  The deaths in the western half of the state could be a reflection of fatal injuries incurred at railroad-building work-sites, or from trainmen traveling along brand-new miles of track to which they were not yet accustomed.</div>			<div class="number floatright">21</div>

Ben McGovern&#39;s year had an ominous start in 1885.  He was a switchman&mdash;an occupation responsible for coupling railcars at large railroad depots such as the division points&mdash;for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.  On New Year&#39;s Day, McGovern, like so many before and after him, had a coupling accident at Pueblo, Colorado.  Fortunately, he only hurt his fingers instead of mashing them or cutting them off completely like brakemen Smith, Prince, and Conway.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>32</sup></font></a>  McGovern survived a railroad accident with only minor injuries.  Others were not as lucky.  The ensuing bar graph shows the number of accidents divided into categories of accident “types” and the severity of each.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>33</sup></font></a></div>			<div class="number floatright">22</div>

						<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">Although it appears that working on the railroad track was the most dangerous job, the numbers have to be placed in context.  In Group VIII&mdash;Colorado&#39;s geographic classification in the <i>Seventh Annual Report on the Statistics of Railways in the United States</i>&mdash;trackmen and other laborers who worked on fixing and expanding railroad tracks outnumbered switchmen and brakemen by more than two to one during this time period.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>34</sup></font></a>  The most dangerous job, forty-four (16.7%) of the total number of reported injuries, was coupling with brakemen and switchmen constituting the vast majority of these victims.  Although no deaths occurred while coupling, coupling did cause the largest share of “severe” accidents.</div>			<div class="number floatright">24</div>

			<div class="header" style="margin-top:10fpx;padding-bottom:12px;">Conclusion</div>			<div class="text floatleft" style="width:650px;">In total, thirty-two men, or nine percent of the individuals with reported injuries, lost their lives working on the Colorado railroads from July 1884 to June 1885.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>35</sup></font></a>  The cause of their deaths ranged from a railcar fire to train derailment, though being “hit by something” was the most common way to die.  Of the seven men who died due to moving objects, one drowned after being knocked into a river, another was shot by a hobo, and five others were run over by a moving train.<a href="#footnote-1"><font color="red"><sup>36</sup></font></a>  The great irony is that if individual railroad workers did not suffer injury or death there would be little left in the historical record of their lives.

<p id="footnote-1"><sup>12</sup>  A large literature exists on the history of nineteenth-century railroad accidents.  Much of the literature, such as Walter Licht&#39;s <i>Working for the Railroad</i>, discusses the most common injuries incurred by different occupations in the railroad industry.  Aldrich&#39;s <i>Death Rode the Rails</i> and Usselman&#39;s <i>Regulating Railroad Innovation</i> focus on railroad accidents and fatalities (for both passengers and workers), the development of technologies intended to prevent accidents (such as automatic couplers and brakes), the growth of mutual-aid societies and large-scale unions aimed to combat railroad company neglect (like the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the Knights of Labor), and company and national legislation hoping to make the railroad industry safer.</p>
